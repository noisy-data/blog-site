# üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Simple configuration is a core feature of MultiTerm. All configuration is done from a single file: `src/site.config.ts`. This is where you can tailor your website to match your vision.

Please take a look at `src/site.config.ts` for more information about the configuration options.

To add your own content, check out the `src/content` directory. Feel free to remove all the example content and replace it with your own!
